# Xplore

Aim of this project is to learn about game development by creating a simple 2d space shooter with XNA.

I plan to use kenney's great set of free game assets for the project available at www.kenney.nl

Stage 1
  - Basic movement (DONE)
  - Camera follow player center(DONE)
  - Collisions (Boundary done)
  
Stage 2
  - Particles for exhaust (DONE)
  - Zooming camera out on speed increase (DONE)
  - Acceleration physics (Using Lerp currently...)
  
Stage 2.5 (Refactor)
  - Cleanup ScreenManager.cs and screen management in general
  - Define entities that need rendering/updates with interfaces
  
Stage 3
  - Basic enemy behaviour
    - Wander
    - Seek (DONE)
    - Flee (DONE)
  
Stage 4
  - Boulders
   - Random sizes and speeds
   - Other random stuff to make them more fun
   - Boulder collision physics with ship and bullets
    - Shooting them gives player score?
    - Make them explode!
    
  - Planets
    - Random planets
    - Types of planets

Stage 5
  - Further AI
    - Navigate round boulders and planets
    - Grouping movement
    - Advanced bullet leading
